# Blog PHP

### Description

A simple blog on which you can read and post and comment illustrated articles.

### Features

All the basics features of a blog are here. You may :

* Create an account or connect with the dedicated buttons in the header
* Read the articles listed on the landing page by clicking on it
* Search articles with the search bar
* Comment articles (need to be connected)
* Clap (like) the article
* Like comments in the article
* Disconnect from you account

### Admin

You can connect to the admin pannel by accessing the /admin root. You may find the login and password by looking into the php files in the "views folder". On the logging screen, type login and password. On your dashboard, you will be able to :

* Use search bar to sort articles
* Delete articles
* Acces them to modify them

### Possible improvements

There may be some improvements for this blog in the future which I'm to lazy to set up now, such as :

* A well coded, object-oriented router, to replace the very-very-ugly one I set up
* An ability for the root admin to give users admin privileges
* Progressive load infinite scroll for articles on homepage
* Use of a moderation API to filter contents (already used my free key for the two weeks of projects, sorry)


### Easter egg

There's not.
